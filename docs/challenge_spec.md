# Writing a challenge spec

## Note: the spec format is still in development and is subject to change

A *challenge spec* is a YAML file that describes a single challenge so the CLI can
push it to a remote GZ::CTF server with `gz game push-challenge`. The file must be
named `challenge.yml` (or `challenge.yaml`) and live in the challenge directory:

```sh
gz game push-challenge --game-id [game_id] [challenge_directory]
```

`push-challenge` looks for `challenge.yml` first, then falls back to
`challenge.yaml`, in the directory you point it at.

```
my-challenge/
├── challenge.yml      # the spec described on this page
├── attachment.zip     # files referenced from the spec
└── ...
```

## StaticAttachment challenge example

```yaml
title: Baby RSA
category: Crypto
description: |-
  # Baby RSA
  Can you break this textbook RSA?

scoring:
  difficulty: 1.0
  base_points: 500
  min_score_ratio: 0.2
  bloodBonus: true
```

## flags

`flag` is a list of accepted flag strings. Each flag is at most 127 characters.

- **Static** challenges accept the literal flags you list here.
- **Dynamic** challenges require a unique flag for each attachment provided.

## Challenge types

`deployment.deploymentType` must be one of:

| Value               | Meaning |
|---------------------|---------|
| `StaticAttachment`  | A downloadable attachment with fixed flags. |
| `StaticContainer`   | A shared container with fixed flags. |
| `DynamicAttachment` | Per-team attachments (not yet supported by `push-challenge`). |
| `DynamicContainer`  | Per-team containers with dynamic flags (not yet supported by `push-challenge`). |

> **Note:** `push-challenge` does not yet support the dynamic challenge types;
> pushing a `Dynamic*` challenge currently raises an error.

## Categories

`category` must be one of:

`Misc`, `Crypto`, `Pwn`, `Web`, `Reverse`, `Blockchain`, `Forensics`,
`Hardware`, `Mobile`, `PPC`, `AI`, `Pentest`, `OSINT`.

Run `gz list-challenge-categories` to print this list, and
`gz list-challenge-types` for the challenge types.

## Network modes

`deployment.containers.networkMode` must be one of:

| Value      | Meaning |
|------------|---------|
| `Open`     | The container can reach the internet (default). |
| `Isolated` | The container is isolated from external networks. |
