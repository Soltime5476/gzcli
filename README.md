# GZCTF CLI

A CLI built for interacting with [GZ::CTF](https://gzctf.gzti.me/) and its server API.

## Getting Started
### Since the tool is still in development phase, no built package is released yet.

### 1. Clone the repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Soltime5476/gzcli.git
```

### 2. Install the package into your python environment
The easiest way to do so is with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed, simply run   
```sh
cd gzcli
uv sync
``` 
and uv will create a virtual environment with all dependencies installed.

## Example Usages

### login to GZ::CTF remote server
```sh
gz login --url [remote url] --username [username] --password [password]
```

### push a challenge to the remote server
```
gz game push-challenge --game-id [game_id] [challenge_directory]
```
this command requires a `challenge.yaml` containing the challenge spec to be present in the challenge directory, see [writing a challenge spec](docs/challenge_spec.md) for documentations on writing a challenge spec (TODO).

### register (create) a team on the remote server
```sh
gz team register --name [team name] --bio [optional team bio]
```
you must be logged in first (see `gz login`), and each user account can only own one team.

## TODO List
- Implement challenge state tracking for synchorizing remote server status, current implementation will create challenges with duplicate names if called repeatedly
- Complete all API endpoints and data models
- Add account creation command
- Improve help texts and documentations
- Fancy stuff (coloured text, progress bars, autocompletions...)
